!!! note "Summary"
    We give a formula for estimating proximal operators from (possibly noisy) observations of objective function values.

!!! success "Key Steps"
    - [x] Sample points $\mathsf{y^i}$ (via a Gaussian) about the input $\mathsf{x}$
    - [x] Evaluate function $\mathsf{f}$ at each point $\mathsf{y^i}$
    - [x] Estimate proximal by using softmax to combine the values for $\mathsf{f(y^i)}$ and $\mathsf{y^i}$

!!! abstract "Abstract"

    First-order optimization algorithms are widely used today. Two standard building blocks in these algorithms are proximal operators (proximals) and gradients. Although gradients can be computed for a wide array of functions, explicit proximal formulas are known for only limited classes of functions. We provide an algorithm, HJ-Prox, for accurately approximating such proximals. This is derived from a collection of relations between proximals, Moreau envelopes, Hamiltonâ€“Jacobi (HJ) equations, heat equations, and Monte Carlo sampling. In particular, HJ-Prox smoothly approximates the Moreau envelope and its gradient. The smoothness can be adjusted to act as a denoiser. Our approach applies even when functions are accessible only by (possibly noisy) black box samples. We show that HJ-Prox is effective numerically via several examples.
